  abstract  = {Extreme climatic events are growing more severe and frequent, calling into question how prepared our infrastructure is to deal with these changes. Current infrastructure design is primarily based on precipitation Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves with the so-called stationary assumption, meaning extremes will not vary significantly over time. However, climate change is expected to alter climatic extremes, a concept termed nonstationarity. Here we show that given nonstationarity, current IDF curves can substantially underestimate precipitation extremes and thus, they may not be suitable for infrastructure design in a changing climate. We show that a stationary climate assumption may lead to underestimation of extreme precipitation by as much as 60%, which increases the flood risk and failure risk in infrastructure systems. We then present a generalized framework for estimating nonstationary IDF curves and their uncertainties using Bayesian inference. The methodology can potentially be integrated in future design concepts.}

  abstract       = {Climate change is one of the prominent factors that causes an increased severity of extreme precipitation which, in turn, has a huge impact on drainage systems by means of flooding. Intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves play an essential role in designing robust drainage systems against extreme precipitation. It is important to incorporate the potential threat from climate change into the computation of IDF curves. Most existing works that have achieved this goal were based on Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis combined with various circulation model simulations. Inspired by recent works that used machine learning algorithms for spatial downscaling, this paper proposes an alternative method to perform projections of precipitation intensity over short durations using machine learning. The method is based on temporal downscaling, a downscaling procedure performed over the time scale instead of the spatial scale. The method is trained and validated using data from around two thousand stations in the US. Future projection of IDF curves is calculated and discussed.},

  abstract       = {The design storm derived from intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves is the main input for hydrologic analysis or hydraulic design for flood control. The regions with higher flood risks due to extreme precipitation are often deficient in precipitation gauges. This study presents a detailed evaluation of IDF curves derived using IMERG Final half-hourly precipitation (V06), fitted with the widely used CDFs: Gumbel and MLE, Gumbel and MM, Pearson 3, and GEV. As benchmarks and following the same method, we also derived IDF curves using areal average gridded precipitation constructed from two dense gauges networks over (1) the WegenerNET Feldbach region in the Alpine forelands of Austria and (2) the gauge network of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, in a semiarid region of the United States. In both regions, the frequency analysis for return periods between 2 and 100 years was based on half-hourly rainfall and compared at a grid-scale with a spatial resolution of IMERG, 0.1° × 0.1° lat/lon. The impact of order in which the gridded gauge-based precipitation average is performed within an IMERG grid was evaluated by computing two different Annual Maximum Series (AMS). In one, the average was computed before obtaining the AMS (AB-AMS), and in the other, the average was computed after obtaining the AMS for each gauge grid (AA-AMS) within the IMERG grid. The evaluation revealed that IMERG AMS agrees better with AB-AMS than AA-AMS for the two study regions. Lastly, it was found that the use of Gumbel distribution in calculating IMERG IDF curves results in better agreement with the ground truth than the use of the other three distributions studied here. The outcomes should provide valuable knowledge for the application of IMERG precipitation over regions with sparse gauges.},
