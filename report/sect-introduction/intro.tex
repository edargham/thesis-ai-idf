The following sections in the article will detail the methodology used for the acquisition and preprocessing of satellite-based precipitation data from the GPM mission, as well as the development and configuration of multiple ML and DL architectures—including SVR, ANN, TCN, and the novel TCAN—for the construction of IDF curves, provide a rigorous comparative analysis of these models, emphasizing their efficacy in constructing IDF curves, discuss these findings within existing literature, underscoring the implications for urban infrastructure planning and the advantages of advanced deep learning approaches over traditional statistical methods, and highlight the integration of remote sensing and artificial intelligence as a pathway to more reliable and resilient hydrological design under non-stationary climate conditions.
