Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves represent a fundamental tool in hydrological engineering for analyzing precipitation patterns and designing water infrastructure~\cite{nhess-24-873-2024, doi:10.1061/TACEAT.0004286}. 
These mathematical functions establish critical relationships between the intensity of rainfall events, their duration, and frequency of occurrence, serving as the central component for modern water resource management and infrastructure design~\cite{egusphere-2025-621}.
IDF curves have evolved from early empirical formulations in the 1930s to sophisticated statistical tools that are essential for flood forecasting, urban drainage design, and climate resilience planning~\cite{GonzalezAlvarez2017, doi:10.1061/TACEAT.0004286}.
