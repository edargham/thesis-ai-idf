Despite these promising developments in applying machine learning to IDF curve construction, several critical limitations remain unaddressed. Existing ML approaches have primarily focused on temporal disaggregation tasks or have been limited to simple neural network architectures that cannot fully capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in precipitation data. Furthermore, the integration of satellite-based precipitation data with advanced deep learning models, such as temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and attention mechanisms, is still largely unexplored. Current methods also lack real-time IDF generation, limiting their usefulness for infrastructure management and flood forecasting. Additionally, uncertainty quantification in ML-based IDF predictions is often overlooked, despite its importance for engineering decisions. Addressing these gaps could enable adaptive, data-driven IDF curves that support resilient infrastructure, even in ungauged regions.
