\subsection{Data Collection}
Daily and sub-daily precipitation data were collected from the GPM-IMERG Version 07 Final Run product using Google Earth Engine and NASA Giovanni platforms.
The GPM-IMERG Version 07 Final Run represents the latest research-quality gridded global multi-satellite precipitation estimates with comprehensive algorithmic improvements implemented in response to user feedback on Version 06 incorporating wide-ranging enhancements such as improved intercalibration processes, corrected spatial gridding to fix geolocation offsets, upgraded infrared precipitation retrieval schemes, and the inclusion of passive microwave estimates over frozen surfaces for near-complete global coverage~\cite{}.
To validate the reliability of the GPM-IMERG data, precipitation samples were extracted and compared with corresponding measurements from Meteostat, and the datasets were found to be matching.
Meteostat was selected as the reference dataset due to its established reliability for rainfall measurements, as it provides high-quality observational data by collecting information from national meteorological services that operate standardized weather station networks with rigorous quality control procedures, making it particularly suitable for validation of satellite-derived precipitation products~\cite{}.
