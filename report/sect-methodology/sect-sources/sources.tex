\subsection{Data Collection}
Daily and sub-daily precipitation data were collected from the GPM-IMERG Version 07 Final Run (It. 07) product using Google Earth Engine and NASA Giovanni platforms.
The GPM-IMERG It. 07 represents the latest research-quality gridded global multi-satellite precipitation estimates with comprehensive algorithmic improvements implemented in response to user feedback on Version 06 incorporating wide-ranging enhancements such as improved intercalibration processes, corrected spatial gridding to fix geolocation offsets, upgraded infrared precipitation retrieval schemes, and the inclusion of passive microwave estimates over frozen surfaces for near-complete global coverage~\cite{21}.
To validate the reliability of the GPM-IMERG data, precipitation samples were extracted and compared with corresponding measurements from ground-based stations, and the datasets were found to be matching.
