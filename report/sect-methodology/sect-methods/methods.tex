\subsection{Construction and Training}
The IDF curves are constructed using the Gumbel Distribution fitted to the yearly maximum intensities using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for each duration to determine the location and scale parameters.
Using these parameters, The return period intensities are calculated through the Gumbel inverse cumulative distribution function, resulting in IDF curves that serve as the statistical benchmark for evaluating the ML models.

To train the ML and DL models, as input, the duration of the event is taken and as output the maximum intensity of the duration for a year in the dataset. The year is dropped from the input as it prevents the model from properly learning the duration-intensity patterns~\cite{14}. For TCNs and TCANs, the data is rearranged into proper sequences as input. Additionally, 50\% of the data is allocated for fitting the models to the data and 50\% for validating the models to ensure the models properly generalize.

For each ML and DL model, the detailed hyperparameter configuration used for training is provided in~\ref{tab:hyperparameters}; details on the training algorithms and optimization strategies are also included for each model in the following sections.
