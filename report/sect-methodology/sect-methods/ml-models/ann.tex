\subsubsection{Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)}

The ANN model was trained to predict the log-transformed annual maximum rainfall intensity using both the log-transformed event duration and log-transformed return period as inputs. The dataset was standardized and split into 50\% for training and 50\% for validation to ensure robust generalization. The neural network architecture consisted of two hidden layers with 24 neurons each, ReLU activations, and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

Model training was performed using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 over 2500 epochs, minimizing mean squared error loss. After training, predictions were inverse-transformed and exponentiated to recover the original intensity scale. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics across all return periods, and the resulting ANN-based IDF curves were compared visually and quantitatively against the Gumbel-distribution-based benchmarks.

The selected hyperparameters for the ANN model are as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Hidden Layers} &: 2 \\
\text{Neurons per Layer} &: 24 \\
\text{Activation} &: \text{ReLU} \\
\text{Dropout Rate} &: 0.2 \\
\text{Optimizer} &: \text{Adam} \\
\text{Learning Rate} &: 0.0001 \\
\text{Epochs} &: 2500 \\
\end{align*}

The UAT states that a feedforward neural network with at least one hidden layer and a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continuous function on a compact domain. As a result, ANNs are particularly well-suited for predicting IDF curves, even when the underlying hydrological processes are highly nonlinear and difficult to model analytically.
