\subsection{Machine Learning Models}
To train the machine learning models, we take as input the duration of the event, and as output the maximum intensity of the duration for a year in the dataset~\cite{idfkoya}. The year is dropped from the input as it impeaches the model from properly learning the duration-intensity patterns~\cite{idfkoya}. For TCNs and TCANs, certain provisions were made to rearrange the data into proper sequences as input, to be discussed in the section below. Additionally, 60\% of the data is allocated for fitting the models to the data and 40\% for validating the models to ensure the models properly generalize.
