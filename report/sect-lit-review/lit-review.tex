\section{Literature Review}
The statistical and probabilistic distribution functions used to construct IDF curves have been the subject of extensive research, and were found to be very effective in designing infrastructure under a stationary climate assumptions. However, the elements of variability and uncertainty in precipitation patterns have become a cause of concern, especially with the increasing impact of climate change on precipitation patterns.~\cite{Cheng2014}. This calls into question the readiness the current urban infrastructure to deal with these changes, especially since the stationarity climate assumption may lead to an underestimation of extreme precipitation by as much as 60\%.~\cite{Cheng2014}. This has led to a growing interest to develop IDF construction methods that no longer rely on the stationarity assumption, and instead to develop methods that can adapt to the changing climate and precipitation patterns using methods such as bayesian inference or other distributions entirely.~\cite{Cheng2014}\cite{hess-2020-173}\cite{hess-27-2075-2023}\cite{hess-25-6133-2021}. Using machine learning and deep learning methods to construct IDF curves is a relatively new approach, with only a handful of studies that have emerged recently exploring this alternative~\cite{idfkoya}

Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods have only recently started to appear in literature as an alternative to the traditional statistical methods used to construct IDF curves~\cite{idfkoya}, this trend still needs to gain traction, and more studies are needed to explore the potential of these methods. Per the universal approximation theorem (UAT), deep learning models are by design capable of capturing non-linear relationships in data, and are capable to estimate any function or distribution given enough data [Goodfellow I. et.al]. However artificial neural networks on their own still struggle with modeling stochastic processes and uncertainty [].

In the paper, ``Machine Learning for Projecting Extreme Precipitation Intensity for Short Durations in a Changing Climate''~\cite{geosciences9050209}, Hu H. and Ayyub Bilal M. propose a machine learning solution to temporaly downscale daily rainfall data and leverage the downscaled data to generate IDF curves. The data used for this study was sourced from daily rainfall data obseved from two thousand stations across the United States of America. The authors highlighted that most of the downscaling on rainfall data took place in the spacial domain, thus they propose to do the same on the temporal domain.~\cite{geosciences9050209}

The primary input to the machine learning model is the daily rainfall data, as the authors stated that many global climate models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) offer only daily rainfall data rather than sub-daily precipitation data. This apporach makes the method widely applicable to leverage readily available daily climate projections to generate IDF curves.~\cite{geosciences9050209} using the daily rainfall data as input, and the observed subdaily resolutions as labels, the ML models would learn to estimate the downscaled precipitation data, which then could be used to construct IDF curves for different durations using the known distributions.

The authors in this paper used machine learning in the preprocessing of the IDF generation process. The data is not being used to replace any of the statistical distribution used to generate IDF curves from  annual maximas and extreme rainfall events, but rather in the steps before that to prepare the data. Furthermore, the authors relied on data from two-thousand ground stations in the United States, and did not leverage any remotely sensed precipitation data for this task.

In the paper ``Utilizing Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Precise Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curve Predictions''~\cite{idfkoya} Ameen, Sheeraz M. \emph{et.~al.} compared several machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models with traditional statistical models using the Gumbel distribution to construct IDF curves.

The initial intuition is that Gumbel only performs well on stationary data that doesn't change over time, but fails to capture the changes in rainfall trends due to climate change, something that ML and DL are well suited for.~\cite{idfkoya}

The authors collected rainfall data in Koya, Iraq from 2005 to 2022, from multiple governmental and institutional sources, consisting of 5-minute, 10-minute, 20-minute, 30-minute, 60-minute, 120-minute, 180-minute, 360-minute, 720-minute and 1440-minute intervals. Using this data, the authors from one end, used Gumbel to construct the IDF curves to establish a benchmark, and from the other end, train Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the IDF curves.~\cite{idfkoya}

To train the models, the authors split the rainfall data into a training set, using the data from 2005 to 2015 and a validation set from 2016 to 2022. The metrics used to evaluate each model were the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R$^{2}$) values. The study revealed that the LSTM model outperformed the other ML and DL model as well as the Gumbel distribution, achieving the lowest RMSE (1.44 mm/hr), lowest MAE (0.81 mm/hr) and the Highest R$^{2}$ (0.99) values.~\cite{idfkoya}

The authors in this study however, relied on governmental and station data sources, and did not source any data using remote sensing technologies or satellite data.
